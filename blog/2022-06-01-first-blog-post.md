#### Fellow Sharks 
As you know, we launched our Founders Pass over the weekend, and soon; our exclusive founders area will be revealed allowing you to monitor your Shark Labs NFTs, share them to social media and more.

#### ßWhat’s all the fuss about?
While having the ability to record NFT ownership to the blockchain in this format may not seem like a big deal, it does pave the way for future developments, particularly with respect to the web3, metaverse, blockchain solutions and integration into real world solutions.  We are always on the lookout to innovate web3 and blockchain  and test out new ideas.

The Shark Labs Founders Pass will be the key NFT for the community, and will allow access to an exciting exclusive rewards program - from free NFT drops to exclusive community areas for AMAs and more.

#### Showcase other projects
While we are all about promoting Shark Labs, our concept is about encouraging diversity throughout the NFT community, primarily because we are massive fans of the concept. The Shark Labs community is all-inclusive; if NFTs win, we all win, and it’s a constant theme that has resonated amongst holders.  The wonderful thing about the NFT space is that it is constantly changing and evolving; no one knows what it will look like in a few months, let alone a few years. It is an exciting time to be involved.

#### So what’s next for Sharks?
We love NFTs and gaming - and this will certainly be our focus while the wider development team continue to discuss the subject of the web3 development and incorporating this into the ‘real-world’ web applications and how this could function - and be a part of everyday life; is in conversation right now. 

Essentially, there are unlimited possibilities for the future, with how advertisers, the development team and our community interact with each other to create the future for Shark Labs and its Developments.
