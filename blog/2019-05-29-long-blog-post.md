Sharks Frenzy
We’re really excited about oue journey and web3 & digital ownership with our community — it’s why we started with Sharks Labsions — to explore the possibilities.

So, we’ve decided we will be hosting a “pitch your project” event in our Discord. New and upcoming projects will have the opportunity to pitch their ideas to our community in one of our Discord stages, live!! 

So how does the event work? We will have a panel of experts and host running the Discord stage. The guests will have 120 seconds to pitch their ideas! The panel will provide their input and ask questions about the project and its goals. Ultimately, our community will have a hand in deciding whether they believe in the pitch via a voting system. 

If the pitch is successful, the project will be required to commit certain offerings/privileges to the Shark Labs community, such as whitelist spots, NFTs from the collection, free membership to the service, etc.

If you’re reading this & are interested — please complete the google form to express your interest, and our team will review the applications for our first event.

If you’re interested in becoming a host — please reach out to @Sharky and include relevant experience.

So — who has the nerves enough to enter the Shark Tank?
